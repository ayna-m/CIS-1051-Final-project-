# Proposal
I want to build a website or an app, have not decided yet, that helps to design fashion items using AI, speficially OpenAI's DALL-E. 
## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Designing clothing using DALL-E
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website or an app will allow creating different designs in clothing and patterns in fabric to ultimately create unusual and creating clothing pieces. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

First feature is creating different patterns and images on fabric and using the created fabric to create ordinary clothing pieces (T-shirt, sweatshirt, etc.). The user would need to give certain theme for DALL-E to create an image (ex: "cosmic dust"), and software will take the image and make it either a patterned fabric or just an image on clothing piece (ex: sweatshirt with image in the middle) 
Second feature is creating actual clothing using AI. User would need to give certain clothing piece, like overalls, for DALL-E to come up with different designs of overall. User then can chose whichever design they like, and maybe change color of the clothing piece.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not combining this project with any other final projects I am taking.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am not collaborating with anyone.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think both features are accomplishable. The only thing I am concerned about is 3D models of the clothing pieces that the shoftware will generate, which I would love to do but I am not sure if I will be able to. So I think making the designs in 2D will be my first goal.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Making designs 3D.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Making designs 3D.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

How to implement DALL-E into website or app
How to work with 2D and 3D clothing models
How to build website or app and add different features.
