#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a stremlit website for the project and created all of the pages needed. There are 10 webpages overall and two pain paths that user can take: designing just clothes or designing patter on graphic clothes

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I did not connect DALL-E to the website yet and did not design the pages that would alter the color of the designs.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

No problems yet, but altering the images of fashion items (ex:color) might be challenging.
