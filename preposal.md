# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I will be double dipping this final project with my BIOL 5514 (Biological Models in Python). The project is related to my current research project, which detecting positive selection in proteins. I am planning to work on comparing distance between substituted sites in positive selection vs. negative selection. My hypothesis is that the distance between substituted sites that undergo positive selection will be shorter (subsituted sites are clustered) than distance between substituted sites that undergo negative selection.

Here are some definitions of the genetic terms that might be confusing:
Positive or directional selection - when one type of gene is favored over another due to natural selection, so it sweeps away other types of genes. Example can be favoring small beeks in finches during wet periods because most of the seeds are small.

Negative selection - removal of deleterious types of genes by natural selection. In the example above, if the weather changes and seeds became bigger, having small beak would be deleterious, so natural selection would get rid of finches with small beaks (make their fitness lower).

Substituions - one type of mutations where one DNA base is substituted with another, for example adenine is substituted with guanine. Genes are hundreds and thousands of bases in them, so there can be many substitutions happening in one gene. The distance between those substitutions (counting how many bases are in between them) can tell if the substitutions are clustered, which could be indicative of positive selection.

Distance between substitued sites - 
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am planning to work alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is the idea too complicated and niche for this course? Should I chose something more general to work on?
